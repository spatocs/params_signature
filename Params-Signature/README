Params-Signature

Params::Signature provides a simple, signature-based way to validate subroutine parameters in a way that mixes type validation associated with modules like Method::Signatures and the type of callback-based validation used by Params::Validate.

Basically, it provides a user-defined type system but eliminates the need for Moose.  In addition, it provides a simple way to validate parameters using callbacks, but using a specification that is somewhat less verbose than Params::Validate.

External dependencies have been kept to a minimum to make the module more lightweight and easier to install.
